= dap's vimrc

== Managing packages

Packages are managed using "Vanilla" Vim 8 packages.  They're just submodules in
`./pack/plugins/start`.  To install a new one, clone it with something like
this:

    $ git submodule add https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim rust-lang-rust.vim

Help tags have to be generated separately in order to search the help.  You can
do this within vim with:

    :helptags ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/rust-lang-rust.vim/doc

== TODO

* Rust support
** get code actions working
** integrate diagnostics better?
** check docs for the above modules to see what I could be doing better
* Make another edit pass over ~/.vimrc
* Get better Markdown support
* "solarized" color scheme
* another prune pass over "ftdetect", "after"?
* check out:
** 'jclulow/vim-javascript'
** 'ciaranm/securemodelines'
** 'cespare/vim-toml'
